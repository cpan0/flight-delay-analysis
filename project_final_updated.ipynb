    "In recent years, the air transport industry has grown rapidly. It promotes tourism, generates economic growth, and provides employment opportunities (Air Transport Action Group, 2022). However, there is no denying that flight delays are becoming more frequent. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers a flight to be delayed if it departs 15 minutes after the scheduled time (Trefis Team, 2016). Delays not only inconvenience passengers but also cost airlines billions of dollars and disrupt airport operations, damaging the airline's reputation (Wang et al., 2019). Because airline industries across the world take up a great part of the global economy, the number of flight delays could have a significant impact on customers’ satisfaction with the airlines. Therefore, it is important to investigate and understand the key factors that can influence flight delays. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will use the 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations dataset published by the U.S. Department of Transportation (2017) to investigate the possible variables that are associated with flight delays and make predictions about the average departure time delay based on the conclusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes 14 unique airlines from the United States, but for this project, we will select Delta Airlines as our subject. Delta Airlines is currently the second-largest airline in the world in terms of total U.S. passenger miles and passenger fleet size, and it is a founding member of the SkyTeam alliance, which has more than 325 destinations in 52 countries on six continents (Wikipedia, 2022). We suppose the study of Delta Airlines will be representative and generalizable for the US airline population. We will examine thirteen potential factors from a total of 31 variables that influence airline delays. \n",
    "\n",
    "These 13 variables include `MONTH`, `DAY`, `DAY_OF_WEEK`, `AIRLINE`, `ORIGIN_AIRPORT`, `DESTINATION_AIRPORT`, `SCHEDULED_DEPARTURE`, `DEPARTURE_TIME`, `DEPARTURE_DELAY`, `SCHEDULED_TIME`, `ELAPSED_TIME`, `AIR_TIME`, and `DISTANCE`. After determining which of the 13 factors can affect airplane delay times, we will use these variables to predict delta airline delay time. We mainly selected those variables because the size of the original dataset is too large and factored out the variables that have little to no effect on the final model, such as the airplane’s tail number, whether the flight was cancelled or not, etc. After determining which of the 13 factors can affect airplane delay times, we will use these variables to predict delta airline delay time."

    "In our analysis, we are predicting average flight delays for Delta’s airline in 2015. In this report, we began by loading our dataset from Kaggle, and tidying the data in order to select the variables and columns that we are investigating. For initial visualizations, we began by checking the correlation of variables, as we want to see which variables would be best to predict departure delay time. We made a correlation matrix plot which shows us that some variables are highly correlated. We could also tell that there exist some high amounts of multicollinearity between certain variables. We believe that this report is trustworthy because we have collected real data from a very large data set. From a sample of over 800,000 individual samples, we took a random sample of 5,000 to make sure we do not have a biased sample. We also believe that since there is so much data, we can generate an accurate model that will allow us to have accurate predictions on delay time in flights. We will also be able to test our model to see how accurately it can predict departure delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan on making a generative model to determine flight delay time, as well as confidence intervals to determine how accurate our model is. We will be splitting our data set into test and training data, and then using a forward stepwise selection process to determine the most accurate model we can make. From there, we can make our best fit model and then test how well we are able to predict departure delay time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to achieve an accurate model that correctly predicts flight delays. This way, we can make true evaluations on flights with Delta and how likely your flight is to be delayed. This leads to a large impact because everyone can use this data in their own lives. For example, if we find that one airport location is a lot more likely to be delayed with delta, we may be more cautious and avoid flying there for a layover. Furthermore, you can use these calculations to compare with other airline companies to figure out which airline is the most reliable and has the least flight delays. Many applications are useful with this information and our analysis. Overall, this analysis creates a huge impact because flights are common and understanding the reasoning behind flight delays is extremely helpful.\n"
